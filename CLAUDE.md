# _modules — Claude Code Instructions

## Working rules (every session, local or cloud)

- **Language:** everything written to a file is English: code comments, UI
  strings, API error messages, log output, README, JSON descriptions, commit
  messages. Chat with the owner in Swedish. No emojis unless asked.
- **`docs/` is local-only.** It is a scratch area between the owner and Claude,
  gitignored on purpose. Never commit it and never `git add -f` it. A cloud
  session will not see it; ask the owner to paste what you need.
- **No secrets in git:** `.env`, `.env.*`, dated backups like `.env.bak-*`,
  keys and tokens. Read `git status` before every commit.
- **Target platform:** the owner self-hosts on a Raspberry Pi (linux/arm64,
  Node 20) and an x86 Linux box, as Docker images behind Traefik. Code must
  build and run on linux/arm64 with Node 20. Check that any new native
  dependency ships arm64 builds.
- **Cloud sessions cannot reach production:** no host, no live database, no
  `.env`, no container logs. Deliver work as a branch and a PR whose
  description says how to verify it live. Deploy and live verification are
  done by the owner on the host. Do not claim something works in production.
- **Data safety:** never blanket-`DELETE` or `rm` a database or data directory
  to clean up after a test; remove only what the test created.
- **Keep diffs about the change:** do not reformat code you are not otherwise
  touching. Run `prettier --check` before `prettier --write` on an older file.
- **Archive, don't delete:** don't delete branches; tag them `archive/<name>`
  first.
